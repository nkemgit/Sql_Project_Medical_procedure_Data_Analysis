This project presents an in-depth analysis of anonymised medical data aimed at enhancing process efficiency and operational performance within a hospital environment, similar to NHS standards. The primary objective is to deliver actionable insights into surgical performance, focusing on metrics such as the frequency of common procedures, completion rates, surgeon performance evaluations, and theatre utilisation. These analyses support data-driven recommendations for improving clinical and operational outcomes. The dataset utilised for this project is available in the Sql_load_file and is managed in a PostgreSQL database.
